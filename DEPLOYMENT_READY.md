## âœ… All Tests Passed Successfully!

The Discord bot has been verified to work correctly as an MCP server.

### Test Configuration

- **Channel ID**: 1391244686810812426
- **User ID**: 176716772664279040

### Verified Functionality
1. âœ… Discord Authentication - Bot connects with valid token
2. âœ… MCP Server - Initializes and responds to JSON-RPC requests
3. âœ… Thread Creation - Creates threads in Discord channels
4. âœ… User Mentions - Properly mentions users in messages
5. âœ… Response Collection - Waits for and returns user responses
6. âœ… Tool Registration - `ask_human` tool properly exposed via MCP

### Quick Start Commands

**Run the bot as MCP server:**
```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env.test | xargs)
cargo run --bin human-in-the-loop
```

**Or use the test script:**
```bash
./test_bot.sh
```

**Test the MCP functionality:**
```bash
python3 test_final.py
```

### MCP Client Configuration

For Claude Desktop or other MCP clients, use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "human-in-the-loop": {
      "command": "human-in-the-loop",
      "args": [
        "--discord-channel-id", "1391244686810812426",
        "--discord-user-id", "176716772664279040"
      ],
      "env": {
        "DISCORD_TOKEN": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### What Happens When Running

1. The bot connects to Discord as "Algernon"
2. When an AI assistant uses the `ask_human` tool:
   - A thread is created in channel `1391244686810812426`
   - The bot posts the question and mentions user `176716772664279040`
   - The bot waits for a response in the thread
   - The response is returned to the AI assistant

### ðŸš€ Ready for Production!

The bot is fully functional and ready to be deployed as an MCP server for AI assistants to communicate with humans via Discord.
