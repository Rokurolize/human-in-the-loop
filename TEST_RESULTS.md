   - Bot name: Algernon#1887
   - Bot ID: 763366800213016606

2. **MCP Server Initialization**: The MCP server starts and initializes correctly
   - Protocol version: 2024-11-05
   - Server responds to initialization requests
   - Proper JSON-RPC communication established

3. **Tool Registration**: The `ask_human` tool is properly registered
   - Tool appears in the tools/list response
   - Correct input schema defined

4. **Discord Connection**: Basic Discord connection works when tested independently
   - Bot connects to Discord gateway
   - Can send messages to channels

### ‚ùå Issues Found

1. **Channel Type Error**: When calling the `ask_human` tool, received error:
   ```json
   {
     "code": -32603,
     "message": "Cannot execute action on this channel type"
   }
   ```
   
   **Possible causes:**
   - Channel ID `1350964414286921749` might be:
     - A DM channel (threads cannot be created in DMs)
     - A channel where the bot lacks "Create Public Threads" permission
     - A forum channel or other special channel type

### üìã Recommendations

1. **Verify Channel Type**: 
   - Ensure the channel is a regular text channel in a server (guild)
   - Check that it's not a DM, forum, or announcement channel

2. **Check Bot Permissions**:
   - Bot needs these permissions in the target channel:
     - Send Messages
     - Create Public Threads
     - Read Message History
     - View Channel

3. **Test with Different Channel**:
   - Try using a different text channel in your Discord server
   - Ensure the bot has been added to the server with proper permissions

## Quick Test Commands

1. **Test Discord connection only**:
   ```bash
   export $(grep -v '^#' .env.test | xargs) && cargo run --bin test_discord
   ```

2. **Run full MCP test**:
   ```bash
   python3 test_final.py
   ```

3. **Manual test with different channel**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.test with new channel ID, then:
   python3 test_final.py
   ```

## Next Steps

1. Verify the channel ID is for a regular text channel in your Discord server
2. Check bot permissions in that channel
3. Re-run the tests with proper channel configuration
4. Once working, the bot is ready for deployment as an MCP server
